# DGEP
**GEP_sym.m**: only optimization process

**apl_CCA.m**: an application of GEP; communication+optimization process

**gene_dcca.m**: classification on gene datasets



# final DGEP
**exp1.m**: synthetic DGEP, including dsvd.m (DGEP-PM-multiround exactly), yyplot.m

**exp3.m**: standard FDA

**exp4.m**: DGEP on FDA, including plot_fda.m (to see the classification performance of projected vectors)
